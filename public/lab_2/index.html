        <h2>Starting dates</h2>
            <p> 
                Dear Dover,<br><br>

                <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at UMD's iSchool to study for your undergraduate in <time datetime="2020-06-21">2020</time>. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br><br>
                </p>

                Starting dates<br>
                <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br><br>
                </p>
                <ul>  
                    <li>First semester: 29 August 2020</li> 
                    <li> Second semester:  22 January 2021 </li>
                    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2021 </li>
                </ul>
                
               <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br><br></p> 

                <p>You can find more information about important university dates on our website.<br><br></p>
            </p>
    
        <h2>Subjects of study</h2> 
            <p>
                At the iSchool, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of information studies. You seem<br>
                like a committed researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
                by are as follows, in order of priority:<br>
            </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
                    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 33°C (91.4°F), when the audience size exponentially increases<br>
                         (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
                    <li><abbr title ="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title ="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>

                </ol>
        <h2>Animals of the Extended Perambulation</h2>
            <p> 
                Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study animals. To answer your question, my favourite creatures are as follows, with<br> definitions:<br>
                    <br>
                <dl>
                    <dt>The Canadian Polar bear</dt>
                    <dd>A large predator, <em>very</em> hungry these days. Feeds almost entirely on seal.</dd>
                    <dt>The elk</dt>
                    <dd> An elk is a horned ungulate found primarily in the mountainous regions of British Columbia. It can be seen from railways, and also frequently visits the Banff centre for the arts.</dd>
                    <dt>The red-tailed hawk</dt>
                    <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation: many people believe eagles make the screaming noise associated with them on film. This cry is instead the call of the red-tail.</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>or more of my research, see my <a href = "http://umd.edu">research page</a>.</p><br>
                
                Yours sincerely,<br>
